# CodecademyPortfolioProject
This is my 1st portfolio project in React that will display restaurants based on user entered category and location using Yelp API.

So far implemented features:
  The website allows users to scroll up and down to navigate through its content.
  Users can simulate a search by typing in the search bar.
  A list of mock restaurant data is presented to the user.
  Restaurant data is transfered between components using props.

Project's Tech Stack:
  HTML, CSS, JavaScript
