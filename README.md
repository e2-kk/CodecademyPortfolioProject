# CodecademyPortfolioProject
This is my 1st portfolio project in React that will display restaurants based on user entered category and location using Yelp API.
The source code for the project can be found in master branch in src folder.

Before looking up restaurants with the app:
  Create a developer account on YELP's API website https://www.yelp.com/login?return_url=%2Fdevelopers%2Fv3%2Fmanage_app
  Obtain the API key for the app from YELP's API website
  Paste the key to the variable apiKey in /src/utils/api.js
  Before pressing search button, enable YELP's API by clicking “Request temporary access to the demo server” on
  https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/corsdemo

So far implemented features:
  The website allows users to scroll up and down to navigate through its content.
  Users can simulate a search by typing in the search bar.
  A list of mock restaurant data is presented to the user.
  Restaurant data is transfered between components using props.
  Sorting Options change colour when the user clicks on them.
  Users can query for a restaurant based on their location, and sort it by best match, highest rated, and most reviewed.
  Users can view a list of businesses that match their query, sorted by best match, highest rated, or most reviews.
  Users can repeatedly make multiple queries for a restaurant recommendation.
  The app is able to request and returned user-entered restaurant serach data from Yelp API.
  App design is responsive to phone and desktop.
